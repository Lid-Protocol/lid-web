        <FAQCard title="How do the presale referrals work?">
          <p>
            When purchasing tokens during a presale event, there is a fee of
            2.5% applied to purchasing transactions. If someone uses your
            presale referral code, you get the 2.5% fee paid by them! However,
            your original 2.5% fee must still be covered. These referral fees
            are paid in ETH at the conclusion of the presale event.
          </p>
        </FAQCard>

        <FAQCard title="What if I’m past the presale stage?">
          <p>
            We still encourage community involvement and word of mouth through
            referrals post launch. The same fee and referral structure of the
            Presale applies to all post-launch investments. Want a massive
            win? Refer a whale!

        <FAQCard title="How does LID Staking work?">
          <p>
            There is a 2% tax applied to certain transactions in the LID
            Ecosystem. Transactions that are taxed at 2% are Uniswap sells,
            Unstaking LID from the Staking Program, and LID transfers between
            wallets. This amount of 2% is then distributed amongst those who
            are staking LID tokens.

        <FAQCard title="What is Locked Liquidity?">
          <p>
            Uniswap is rife with a certain type of scam – the “rug pull” –
            in which liquidity placed in the liquidity pool is removed from
            unsuspecting traders and investors, thereby rendering their
            purchased tokens valueless. These individuals use this malicious
            intent to get away with ETH funds, often quite substantial in
            amount.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Liquidity Dividends Protocol, through LID Certified Presales,
            has created innovative technology that puts in place automated
            steps to ensure presale raised funds and tokens are locked into
            Liquidity Pools on Uniswap.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once the presale timer has ended, the LID Certified Presale
            Smart Contract then automatically mints the liquidity pool
            tokens and begins burning them. Through this process, the
            liquidity is locked into Uniswap permanently, and is
            untouchable.

        <FAQCard title="What is the point of licensing?">
          <p>
            Liquidity Dividends Protocol developed several unique innovative
            technologies for automatically depositing liquidity generated
            via a Presale Event directly into Uniswap. Along with Liquidity
            Locking, LID Certified Presales also places allocations such as
            Team Tokens under strict time locks. Conceptually, these
            technologies are designed to reduce risk, increase funds raised,
            and to put an end to exit scams. Through licensing, prospective
            projects have a ‘one stop shop’ service to get their project off
            the ground.
